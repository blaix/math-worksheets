Initial setup: `npm install`

Start local dev server: `npm run dev`

The dev server will restart when files change
(but you will need to refresh the browser yourself).

## Now what?

Take a look at `server/src/Main.gren` and `client/src/Components/Equation.gren`.

## Deployment

Create an optimized production build with `npm run build`,
and start the server with `npm start`.
